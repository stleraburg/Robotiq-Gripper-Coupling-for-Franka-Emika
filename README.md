The coupling consists of two parts: electrical and mechanical. PCB represents electrical part and contains 2x5 pogo pins connector. The power pins are traced to their respective connector, as are the RS-485 communication pins. 

There are three mechanical parts. The first one is attached to Franka, next a PCB holder goes, and finally the part to attach the Robotiq gripper. PCB is located between the PCB holder and the gripper part. All parts are screwed with M6 bolts.
